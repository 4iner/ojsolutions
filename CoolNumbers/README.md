**Canadian Computing Competition: 2009 Stage 1, Senior #1**
Eric likes interesting numbers like 64. It turns out that 64 is both a square and a cube, since 64=82 and 64=43. Eric calls these numbers cool. Write a program that helps Eric figure out how many integers in a given range are cool.

# Input Specification
On the first line of input, you are given an integer a such that a≥1 and a≤108. On the second line of input, you are given an integer b such that b≥a and b≤108.

# Output Specification
The output should be the number of cool numbers in the range a to b (inclusively: that is, a and b would count as cool numbers in the range if they were actually cool).
