A palindrome is a word that has the exact same sequence of letters when read forwards or backwards. The words noon and radar are palindromes, whereas the words noob and palindrome are not.

Patty loves palindromes, as she finds them soothing. Patty knows that you can turn any word into a palindrome by adding letters to the left and / or right. For example, you can turn ECOO into OOCECOO or ECOOCE or even DOOCECOOD. Patty loves palindromes so much that any time she sees a word written down somewhere, she immediately converts it to a palindrome in her head.

The input will contain 10 test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing a string of lowercase characters of maximum length of 106. Your code should output the minimum number of letters Patty would need to add to the left and / or the right in order to convert the string to a palindrome.

Note that the sample input below contains only 3 test cases but the actual data files will contain 10.

# Sample Input
ecoo
impala

# Sample Output
