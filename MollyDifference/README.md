Molly loves subtraction. She also loves non-negative numbers. For her birthday, Molly received an array A1,A2,…,AN of integers. To make up for the fact that you forgot to bring her a present, you decide to tell her the minimum value of d such that d=|Ai−Aj|, such that 1≤i,j≤N.

# Subtasks
For all subtasks, −109≤Ai≤109.

# Subtask 1 [40%]
2≤N≤1000

# Subtask 2 [60%]
2≤N≤106

# Input Specification
Line 1: An integer, N.
Line 2: N space separated integers, the array A1,A2,…,AN.

# Output Specification
The minimum value of d.
