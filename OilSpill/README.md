DWITE Online Computer Programming Contest, May 2010, Problem 3
We want to measure globes of the oil spills, by calculating their area from satellite images. There could be multiple disconnected globes in a single image, so the area of interest is marked.

The input will contain 5 testcases, each a 10x10 grid. Each set is followed by a line of 10 = signs, to visually break up test cases

&#35; — oil spill
. — water
A — marks the area of interest
The output will contain 5 lines, integers 1≤N≤100 — area of corresponding oil globes.

Note: only up/down and left/right adjacent cells are connected. Diagonals are not.
